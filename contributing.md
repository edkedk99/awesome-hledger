## Content to be added

The goal of this projects is not have everything related to hledger, but only those that meet some quality standards and may be useful for users at large, so links to tools should follow those conditions:

- Developed with users at large in mind, so avoid tools created for a narrow specific usecase of the developer only.
- It is already working for its purpose. Wait if the basic functionality is still being developed.
- Works fine for current versions of hledger.
- It should have instructions explaining at least how to install and basic usage.
